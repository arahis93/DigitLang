**DigitLang**

***Syntaxis***

There is only one command in the DigitLang. This is the number of the character in the [[ASCII]] table.

***How it work***

When you enter the numeric number of a character in the ASCII table, the interpreter automatically translates its number into a character and displays it on the screen. And so it happens with every character.

***How to run?***

Type "python digitlang.py -f <file_name>" in your terminal.
